## Individual 1 (Yuma Anderson)
```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbchu/ds202_labs/master/choco.csv")
head(choco)
```

1. The chocolate ratings have a Normal distribution. There are two outliers with a score of 5.
```{r}
hist(choco$Rating, xlab = "Rating", main = "Distribution of Chocolate Ratings")
```

```{r}
which.max(choco$Rating)
#Finding maximum score
choco[87, 'Rating']
#Location of maximum score
choco[choco$Rating == '5',]
#Searching for multiples of maximum score
```


2. No, the ratings are not significantly affected by the cacao percentage. They are very slightly negatively correlated, with an inconclusive barplot.

```{r}
barplot(choco$Cocoa.Pct, choco$Rating)

cor(choco$Cocoa.Pct, choco$Rating)
```


3. Company.Location is a factor, which is a data structure similar to a dataframe, and can be ordered or unordered but represent categorical data. Characters represent string values in R, while factors are stored as integers although they look like characters to us. 

```{r}
typeof(choco$Company.Location)
```

## Individual 2 (Hannah Lo)

1. The ratings are distributed in a Normal Distribution. There are two outliers that have a value of 5.

```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbchu/ds202_labs/master/choco.csv")  
hist(choco$Rating, xlab="Rating",main="Histogram of Rating")
```

```{r}
# what is max
which.max(choco$Rating)
# locations of max
choco[choco$Rating == '5',]
```

2. The ratings do not have a significant relationship with caco, showed by a non-conclusive barplot and correlation score.

```{r}
# correlation score
cor(choco$Cocoa.Pct,choco$Rating)

barplot(choco$Cocoa.Pct,choco$Rating)
```

3. The class is factor. This class is different than characters because they only look like categorical data to us, but it is seen as an integer to the machine.

```{r}
typeof(choco$Company.Location)
```

color2 = ifelse(uk_recent$Rating >median(uk_recent$Rating), 'purple', 'red') # Logic test that checks elementwise if the particular rating value from uk_recent is greater than its median. If yes, then purple is returned. If no, red is returned.

```

2. The plot can be improved by changing the y variable to the rating, and creating a legend where the data points are color coded by their cocoa percentage. 

3. The number of ratings vary, with 2015 having the most reviews and 2017 having the least. The mean is around 201 reviews.
```{r}
library(plyr)
choco <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbchu/ds202_labs/master/choco.csv")
head(choco)
number_reviews = count(choco, "Review.Date") # summing the number of observations per year to double check the histogram
recent_rating = choco[choco$Review.Date>2011,]
x = hist(recent_rating$Review.Date, main="Number of Reviews from 2012 to 2017")
```

4. The top three locations with the most ratings from 2012-2017 was The United States, Canada, and France. Surprisingly the ratings are very similar with all three sharing the same median of 3.25.
```{r}
# finding top three
sort(table(recent_rating$Company.Location))
# subsetting top three rating
us = subset(recent_rating,Company.Location =='U.S.A.')
can = subset(recent_rating,Company.Location=='Canada')
fra = subset(recent_rating,Company.Location=='France')
# finding median for top three's ratings
us_med = median(us$Rating)
can_med = median(can$Rating)
fra_med = median(fra$Rating)
# display the medians
us_med
can_med
fra_med
```
5. How do the mean and median ratings compare of the top three most rated countries?
6. Though the medians of the top three are identical, their means vary. France is the closest to the median. The United States must have a low outlier that brought its mean down. And Canada may have a high outlier, pullings its mean up.
```{r}
# finding median for top three's ratings
us_mean = mean(us$Rating)
can_mean = mean(can$Rating)
fra_mean = mean(fra$Rating)
# display the means
us_mean
can_mean
fra_mean
```
