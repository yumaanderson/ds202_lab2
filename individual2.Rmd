1. The ratings are distributed in a Normal Distribution. There are two outliers that have a value of 5.

```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbchu/ds202_labs/master/choco.csv")  
hist(choco$Rating, xlab="Rating",main="Histogram of Rating")
```

```{r}
# what is max
which.max(choco$Rating)
# locations of max
choco[choco$Rating == '5',]
```

2. The ratings do not have a significant relationship with caco, showed by a non-conclusive barplot and correlation score.

```{r}
# correlation score
cor(choco$Cocoa.Pct,choco$Rating)

barplot(choco$Cocoa.Pct,choco$Rating)
```

3. The class is factor. This class is different than characters because they only look like categorical data to us, but it is seen as an integer to the machine.

```{r}
typeof(choco$Company.Location)
```
